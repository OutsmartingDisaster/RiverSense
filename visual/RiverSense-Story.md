# The RiverSense Story

> What if a spare smartphone, the kind many of us have in a drawer, could help protect a neighborhood from a devastating flood?

This is the powerful premise behind **RiverSense**, a low-cost, near-real-time water level monitoring system designed to empower communities on the front lines of climate change.

## 1. Building the Sensor üîß
The journey begins not in a high-tech lab, but with accessible, everyday materials. The RiverSense hardware is intentionally low-cost, utilizing components like:
- PVC pipes
- Sealant
- Cable ties

This approach makes it possible for the sensors to be assembled, deployed, and maintained locally, putting the power of data directly into the hands of the community.

## 2. Community-Led Installation üë•
The true strength of RiverSense is its collaboration with local residents. Here we see a team installing a sensor station on a bamboo structure directly over a river. This hands-on involvement is crucial. By working with the community to place sensors in locations they know are critical, the system is built with invaluable local knowledge, fostering a sense of ownership and trust.

## 3. Repurposing Technology for Data Collection üì±
At the heart of each weather-proof casing is a standard Android smartphone. This repurposed device runs the **RiverSense-App**, which uses a sophisticated technique called *GNSS Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR)*. It measures the signal reflections from GPS satellites off the water's surface to calculate the river's height with remarkable accuracy.

The app interface is simple:
1. Check the satellite status
2. Start logging
3. Begin collecting critical data

## 4. Monitoring and Managing Data üìä
As the system runs, the RiverSense-App saves the raw GNSS data into distinct sessions, timestamped for easy management. This data can be:
- Previewed directly from the device
- Shared instantly with the community
- Reviewed during community meetings

At night or during community meetings, residents can gather to check the system's status and review the collected information, becoming active participants in monitoring their own environment.

## 5. Transforming Data into a Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
The data collected by the phones is transmitted to the **RiverSense-Server** for processing. Here, the complex GNSS-IR analysis is performed, converting raw signals into a clear, understandable measurement: the river's water level. This information is then used to generate vital early-warning tools, like this flood hazard map. The color-coded areas show the risk level in near-real-time, giving families and officials the crucial time they need to:
- Prepare for potential flooding
- Protect their property
- Evacuate safely if necessary

*From simple parts and a spare phone, RiverSense creates a complete, life-saving loop‚Äîempowering communities with the data they need to build resilience against the growing threat of flooding.*
